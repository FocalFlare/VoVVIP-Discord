<h1 id="tos--rules">TOS &amp; Rules</h1>
<p>Everything you should follow before interacting. Rules are subject to change at any time!</p>
<h2 id="tos">TOS</h2>
<p><strong>These must be legally enforced on Discord at all times to keep myself, you guys, and this server safe from any potential suspensions.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You must be 13 or older to be on Discord as a whole.</li>
<li>Promoting (or discussions about promoting) illegally-acquired software (pirates, torrents, etc…) is zero-tolerance prohibited from Discord.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li>Respect everyone, including yourself.</li>
<li>Spam and memes are not allowed outside the #spam-and-commands-realm and #meme-realm channels (opt-in only).</li>
<li>Trolling is allowed up to a bare minimum.</li>
<li>NSFW/adult media is zero-tolerance prohibited. If any media involves blood, please spoiler it as such with trigger/censor warnings.</li>
<li>Pinging people is okay so long that it’s not annoying, but do not ping @everyone or @here. If something goes wrong in the server and you need the staff to look into it, please do not hesitate to ping the staff.</li>
<li>Derogatory terms, such as racial slurs and anti-LGBTQ+ slurs, are prohibited. Do not use whataboutisms or double-standards to circumvent this rule.</li>
<li>Keep all self-promo in #self-promo-realm. Do not join this server for the sole purpose of self-promotion.</li>
<li>Keep all drama out of this server. If it has anything to do with altercations between any of my friends, please keep those between you and the other party and out of my DM’s.</li>
<li>Impersonation is zero-tolerance prohibited. If confronted about it, please comply with both the staff and the victim by changing your name(s) or else serious consequences will occur.</li>
<li>Do not make alt accounts or use other people to circumvent punishments you are given. Not only do you risk yourself getting moderated but also the victim as well.</li>
<li><strong>Have fun!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For any violation of these rules, they all start with informing members before what they do, when continued, becomes an offense us <strong>@Sentinel Voidan</strong> have to moderate against. Moderation goes by the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Message deletion</li>
<li>Warning (after 1-2 offenses)</li>
<li>Mute/Timeout (after 3 offenses + 1 warning)</li>
<li>Kick (after 4+ offenses + 2 warnings)</li>
<li>Ban (after 5+ offenses + 3 warnings)</li>
</ol>
<p>While some violations can be appealed, <strong>@Sentinel Voidan</strong> can skip any of these moderation actions, deny appeals of any violation, and ban for any length of time depending on the severity of the violation. If you have any questions or concerns about this, do not hesitate to DM me (<strong>@Overlord Voidan</strong> or any other <strong>@Sentinel Voidan</strong>).</p>
<p>For <strong>@Sentinel Voidan</strong>, if you are about to ban anyone for reasons outside this server, please talk with me and the other staff first before laying the foot down.</p>
<p>Another thing, I intend for this server to be welcoming for all of my friends and not just those who don’t care about the unhinged nature of the main server. Please keep unhinged behavior to a minimum.</p>
<p>With this, I will also do background checks (via join applications) on users for anything that is not wanted in this server. If you get removed from this server for any of the above mentioned, then this may be why. Nothing personal against you, thankfully!</p>
